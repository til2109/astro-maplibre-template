        - str:  "Habitat fragmentation is based on the understanding of evolutionary progression as a network. 
                In order for species to avoid extinction, they must have high genetic diversity which only comes with high contact of other animals not from the same blood line.
                The probability of this contact increases as habitats for species are closer to one another.
                Habitats are therefore function as nodes and the distance between then are the linkages."

        - str: "To question this binary relationship, Same Home focuses on habitat fragmentation calculations, a core metric in Landscape ecology analysis. Habitat fragmentation is a relational metric - the value of land is determined by its context - making it an inherently holistic metric. Its function allows us to understand systems without needing to know the details of its internal function. However, like other network analysis, the matrix of a landscape must be simplified at the cost of microclimatic resolution. Therefore, specific characteristics of a patch are not of value within fragmentation understanding where landscapes are deduced to homogeneous nodes."

        - str: "The matrix understanding is dependent on a classification of land that presupposes animals and humans occupy different spaces and the more “unnatural” the space the less likely animals are to be found there.  By this logic, we would not have diverse animal communities in densely urbanized areas, which we know is not true."

Rather than just mapping standard habitat fragmentation, Same Home creates a metric of mobility that is used to measure the severity of fragmentation at species specific level to present an alternative classification of habitat. Ultimately, this can change our understanding of habitat connectivity and deemphasize the weight of area and edge condition in understanding biodiversity."

I selected three animal species that have been found in the New York Metropolitan Area each with different habitation behaviors: migratory, territorial, and nomadic. Quantitative research for each species’ habitat preferences were then used to calculate a fragmentation distance based on those behaviors. These factors included average resting area, average mating area, average frequency of habitats per land type, as well as maximum and average home range. Each factor was then used to create a weighted average of area needed for survival, thus giving us a species specific fragmentation threshold."
